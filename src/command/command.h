/**
 * Command type
 *
 * This type represents a command exposed via the API.
 * Commands may be invoked in transactions.
 *
 * There are two types of commands:
 *  * Regular commands
 *  * Special commands
 *
 * ### Regular commands
 *
 * Regular commands are commands which consume arguments, have one result and
 * don't have any side effects concerning the processor's operation or state.
 * Arguments and results are passed via a stack (see @ref stack_semantics).
 *
 * Preparation of the stack is done by the `ws_processor`.
 *
 * ### Special commands
 *
 * Special commands _do_ have side effects on the processor.
 * E.g. a jump will increment a processor's (virtual) program counter.
 *
 * Another property of a special command is that it _should not_ have any effect
 * on the stack, _unless_ the command is intended to alter the stack itself.
 * E.g. a `jump` will have no effect on the stack while a `push` will _only_
 * affect the stack.
 * Because of this, parameter passing is done in a completely different way.
 * Instead of receiving a prepared stack, a raw argument list will be passed to
 * the command, along with the processor's context.
 *
 * ### Command type differentiation
 *
 * While both command types do have a name and an implementation in form of a
 * function, the parameters being passed to the function differ considerably.
 * Hence, an additional member, the `command_type` denotes whether the command
 * is a `regular` or a `special` one.
 * A processor may then use the appropriate member of the embedded union `func`.
