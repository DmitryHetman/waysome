/**
 * A command argument
 *
 * Naturally arguments may be passed to commands.
 * This type represents an argument being passed to a command which may be
 * processed by a processor.
 *
 * In most cases, commands take values (@see ws_command), which may be passed
 * via a stack (@see stack_semantics) or directly.
 *
 * To differentiate between those two modes of argument passing, this type
 * contains an enumeration `type`, which may either be set to `direct` or
 * `indirect` denoting whether the argument is to be passed directly or
 * indirectly.
 *
 * Of course, each mode requires the argument to be present in a format
 * suitable for the mode.
 * While the argument is a `ws_value` for an argument passed directly, the
 * argument is given as an _offset_ if it's passed indirectly.
 * Hence, the argument is embedded in a union.
 *
 * The correct usage of this struct is imperative for both construction and
 * usage of instances of this type.
 * To facilitate construction, the functions `ws_statement_append_direct()`
 * and `ws_statement_append_direct()` should be used.

/**
 * Statement
 *
 * This type represents a statement which may be executed by the command
 * processor.
 * A statement is a command invocation, hence a statement only consists of a
 * command (or, to be more precise, of a _pointer_ to a command) and the
 * arguments passed to that very command.
 *
 * Statements should _only_ be constructed using `ws_statement_init()`, which
 * takes care of the `command` field.
 * After construction, arguments may be appended by calls to
 * `ws_statement_append_direct` or `ws_statement_append_indirect`.
