/**
 * Connection buffer
 *
 * When `read()`ing and `write()`ing to a connection, a programmer has to take
 * care of the buffering of incomplete content.
 *
 * E.g. a series of bytes read from a file descriptor may or may not contain
 * a message which may be deserialized by a parser in one run.
 * If a streaming parser is used, residual content, which may be parsed some
 * time in the future, may be left in the buffer.
 * Similarly, a `write()` may not be able to send every last byte of the buffer.
 *
 * The intent behind a connection buffer is to facilitate reading and writing
 * from and to connections by taking care of the leftovers of invocations of
 * either the deserializer or `write()`.
 * This is _not_ implemented as a ring-buffer, since we're assuming relatively
 * small payloads, which may be processed once at a time.
 * Instead, the idea is to have one buffer, which is logically divided into
 * three areas:
 *  * data which may be written to a destination or deserialized
 *  * reserved space, to which a `read()` or a serializer may write to
 *  * free space, which is currently not used
 *
 * While each of these areas may have a size of 0, they are cohesive,
 * interleaving data is not possible.
 *
 *     +--------------+----------------+------------+
 *     | written data | reserved space | free space |
 *     +--------------+----------------+------------+
 *     |                                            |
 *     |<------------ total buffer size ----------->|
 *
 * Upon initialization, a buffer is initialized with an initial size.
 * All of the buffer is considered free space at this point.
 *
 * Writing entities may now reserve memory, which is subtracted from the free
 * space.
 * The reserved space will be passed to the caller, which may now start writing
 * to that memory.
 * Once the writing entity is done writing, it _must_ call `ws_connbuf_append()`
 * to communicate to the `ws_connbuf` that it finalized the write.
 * The amount of bytes passed to that call will be added to the "written data",
 * while the "reserved space" will be reset to `0`.
 *
 * Reading entities may deserialize or `write()` data from the "written data"
 * portion.
 * After doing so, it should `ws_connbuf_discard()`, which will remove the
 * given amount of "written data" by _moving_ the rest of the "written data" and
 * all of the "reserved space" towards the beginning of the buffer.
