/**
 * Connector
 *
 * A `ws_connector` wraps a file descriptor which may be used to send or receive
 * data.
 * For this purpose, it features two embedded `ws_connbuf`s, of which one is an
 * input buffer and one is an output buffer.
 * Both of them are meant to be accessed from external modules and can also be
 * thought of as an "inbox" and an "outbox".
 *
 * If an entity wishes to read data from a connection, it will call
 * `ws_connector_read()`, which performs a `read()` on the embedded file
 * descriptor, filling up `inbuf`.
 * After invoking that function, the reading entity may read data from the
 * `inbuf` and `ws_connbuf_discard()` that data.
 *
 * If an entity wishes to write to a connection, it may feed that data to the
 * `outbuf` and, at some point, call `ws_connector_flush()`.
 * That call will try to `write()` the buffered data to the file descriptor
 * passed and discard the data written, making room for more data.
 *
 * A connection may be read-only.
 * A read-only connection holds an uninitialized `outbuf` which it will not use.
 * E.g. `ws_connector_flush()` will fail on a read-only connection.
